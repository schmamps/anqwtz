# anqwtz

## About

[anqwtz](https://github.com/schmamps/anqwtz) simulates Ryan North's
[Dinosaur Comics](https://qwantz.com/).

This is a simple project to:

1. decouple from [Yu Dereader](https://github.com/schmamps)
1. experiment with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package management

## Running

When you have `poetry` installed, simply execute:

```sh
poetry run flask run
```

This will start the test server on [localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242/),
the host and port tested by Yu Dereader.
